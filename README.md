# MockMyLocation

### Description
Disguise your current location as another of your choice. 

### Options
* Search for and use a custom location 
* Choose a pre-determined location from a list
* Select a random location for fast activation

### Execution
After installation, choose a mock location from the options given. You will be notified to select this app as the location provider for your device the first time you run it.
Then, you can minimize this app and use your device as normal. It will continue to run in the background with your location disguised.

### Dependencies 
* Android Device 4.0 or newer

### Permissions
* Location

## Note:
* MockMyLocation creates mock providers for GPS, Cellular, and Network. However, some apps will query nearby devices via Bluetooth and WiFi networks to validate your location coordinates.
  Unfortunately, this will override your mock settings and allow it to detect your real location.
